                                    <h5><b>Bathrooms</b></h5>
                                    <p>Showers, bathtubs, sinks, drains – Mr. Speedy handles it all. If there’s a leak, we’ll fix it. If a drain is obstructed and won’t flow, we’ll clean it out and remove the obstruction. If a bathroom fixture needs repair, we can make it right again. If it can’t be repaired, we can replace it – our vans are stocked with quality parts and fixtures. Our plumbing technicians will explain the different options open to you, and will advise you on the best way to proceed.</p>

                                    <h5><b>Faucet and Pipe Repair</b></h5>
                                    <p>Even the best faucets, fixtures and pipes eventually wear out with extended use. We can repair or replace any faucet, fixture or pipe in your home or place of business. We are familiar with all types of pipes, including copper and PVC/Plastic. And we carry the latest brands of quality faucets, including Price Pfister, Delta and Moen. Your plumbing tech can give you more advice and help you select the right fixtures.</p>

                                    <h5><b>Toilets</b></h5>
                                    <p>A leaky or defective toilet can cause you to waste a lot of precious water. And a non-functioning toilet can quickly become a health hazard. We repair leaky/defective toilets and get them running smoothly again. If it needs replacing, we provide sales and installation of all major brands of toilets in a variety of models. To save money on your water bills, we suggest you look into installing a new low-flow toilet flush system: these new systems have two flush settings – one for liquid waste, one for solid waste and toilet paper. These new low-flow systems use less water and save you money on your water bills. We carry the leading brands of toilets, including Kohler and American Standard.</p>

                                    <h5><b>Electronic Leak Detection</b></h5>
                                    <p>Pinpointing the exact location of a leak can be very difficult. Mr. Speedy has an array of the most sophisticated electronic leak detection devices that can identify a leak even if it is beneath a concrete slab, deep underground, or even behind a wall. We only start to dig when we know exactly where the leak is. We also have equipment to detect a gas leak on your property.</p>
